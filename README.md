# wrestler
Uses a modified breadth-first-search to break down wrestler rivalries into 'babyfaces' and 'heels'.

To use this script type 'python wrestler.py [filename]' into the command line.

First line of file must be an integer specifiying the number of wrestlers. The lines following must contain a wrestler (1 per line). Then, another line specifying how many rivalries. After that line, more lines outlining what the rivalries are (2 wrestlers per rivavly).
